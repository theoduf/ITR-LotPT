of time, defeating the enemies that you encounter, collecting powerups
and treasures along the way.

## Acknowledgements

Tower Run draws inspiration from a number of video games, most notably:

* The 3D Rotating Tower in
  [*Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse* (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mania).
  In a video he published to YouTube,
  [*Mickey Mania's 3D Rotating Tower - How was it possible?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRzKAe9UtoU),
  [Traveller's Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller%27s_Tales)
  founder and Mickey Mania designer [Jon Burton](https://twitter.com/JonTt)
  explains how he and the rest of the TT crew created their 3D rotating tower
  on the SEGA Genesis. This video inspired me to create my own implementation
  of a rotating tower, and Tower Run is the result of that.

* [*Super Mario 64* (1996)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64).
  Once I had my rotating tower, I found that the look of my creation reminded
  me of this one of the first 3d platformer video games. I decided that I would
  aim to try and make Tower Run as enjoyable and inspiring as this and other
  Mario games had been to me growing up.

* The original [*Crash Bandicoot* (1996)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_%28video_game%29)
  for the Sony Playstation. This game along with the above mentioned
  Super Mario 64 would come to shape the meaning of 3d platform gaming
  for not just an entire generation but for the industry as a whole
  I would say. [Naughty Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naughty_Dog)
  would go on to produce several other video games that I hold in high regard,
  including but not limited to
  [*Jak & Daxter: The Precursor Legacy* (2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter)
  on the Sony Playstation 2 and
  [*Uncharted 4: A Thief's End* (2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter)
  on the Sony Playstation 4. Co-Founder of Naughty Dog,
  [Andy Gavin](https://twitter.com/asgavin) has published
  [dozens of posts on the making of video games on his website](http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/video-games/),
  among which are a series of posts about the making of Crash Bandicoot.
  You should go to [his sorted archive of historfic video game posts](http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/video-games-archive/)
  and read all of the ones about Crash Bandicoot.

* [*Temple Run* (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Run), a more recent
  and simple video game than the above but an inspiration nonetheless.

Additionally there were of course a multitude of other sources including books,
lectures and videos as well as online discussions, on programming, software
engineering and architecture, computer science, graphics programming and
video game design that provided knowledge and inspiration enabling the creation
of this game, but this list is getting about long enough already.
